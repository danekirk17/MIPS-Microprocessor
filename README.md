<h1>MIPS Microprocessor</h1>

This is a Xilinx Vivado 2019 project. \
The design is a 32-bit general purpose microprocessor capable of executing MIPS assembly code instructions. \
The contraints file was populated based on the Nexys A7-100T trainer board built around the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. \
These constraints must be modified if a different board is being used to implement the design.
